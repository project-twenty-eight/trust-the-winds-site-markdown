## Energy Layer // Everything Is About Sex, Except Sex

Sex Is About Energy.

Sex is about Power.

Sex is about Love.

Sex is about Pleasure.

## Energy Layer // Understanding Energies Are Being Exchanged During Sex [Moreso Than Otherwise]

Sex to me... is about...

exchanging energies.

## Energy Layer // Being Intentional About The Intention Behind Sex [For What Reason Are We Having Sex?]

Why are you having sex in the first place?

Have you ever thought about?

For what reason, did you and any number of people (including zero) find themselves in a given scenario?

It's important.

## Energy Layer // Intentional Power Exchanges [Dom/sub]

this is roles and stuff. not role play.

there is a difference.

i'll put some links somewhere in the back of the book.

power in the bdsm sense.

i'm sure this is considered hippie sex.

the power changes make it a D/s thing.

i do identity strongly as a Dominant.

I don't consider myself a Dom. ugh.

If that means something to you, then it does.

soyea... part of the magick.

is that's it's dominant sex.

## Energy Layer // Intentional Kinetic Energy Exchanges

This is the actual physical realm sex happening.

in / out. up / down.

stuff that you can "see" with your eyes.

whatever that means.

Basically stroke game. calculation.

reathym. feminine eneryg. sex energy.

wave. circle. mathematics.

being intentional about how you are doing it.

## Energy Layer // Intentional Kinetic Energy Visualization [Fucking The Star Dust Out Of Her]

you are going to visualize wipples and waves radiation from your partners pelvis.

are you already thrusting her consistently?

good base?

now imagine the lines of kinetic energy bouncing and rediating from her.

all that hydrogen.helium.

you are giving her your physical energy.

University Physics is just lightingup herbody.

now in your mind you can see the star dust coming out of her.

radiating from her.

and we haven't even gotten to the telepathy.

hahahahaha.

am i physcho?

am i full of shit? ionno.

but def try this stuff at home.

## Energy Layer // Inter-Dimensional Space Time Manipulation [Alternate Dimension Teleportation Visualization]

This is hard to explain.

This is gonna sound weird AF.

so... to an outside observer...

you and your parter are having sex

visualizing yourself having sex.

but you aren't visualizing yourself having sex in your bedroom or whatever.

you visualize the place.

it could be the a moon on planet saturn.

it could be the surface of the sun.

it could be the universe itself.

anyways...

hard to beleive, i know.

but... if you are inclined to beleive...

your partner feels it. you feel it.

hehe.

lol.

there is a reason i wrote this book right?

i'll put some links down below for you to check out. 

don't take my work for it.

(Cue the Reading Rainbow theme music).

## Energy Layer // Exploiting Energy Hygeine [The Physical Position You All Are In]

So this can be used to ravishing effects.

the direction / alignment of bodies matters.

you recieve more energy directly behind you.

so focus positions where you are BEHIND your partner.

basically you want to have your eyes focused (sorta) on the back of her head.

it's the hippocampus or something.

anywhere... whatever and wherever that is...

you want that part of her body basically perpendiular to you.

lol or straight/directly in front.

traditional doggie. belly down / flat doggie

are great for this.

lol. #intense? hehe.

## Energy Layer // 100% Anal. 0% Pussy. [Personal Favorite]

This has been well researched.

There is something very primal about anal sex.

If you take everything that i've mentioned before...

And then do it in a girls butthole.

hmm...

why is this book free?

lol.

Please try all of this at home.
